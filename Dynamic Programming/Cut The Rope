Cut The Rope﻿﻿﻿﻿



Given a rope, cut it into parts maximizing the product of their lengths.



Example

Input: 4

Output: 4



Length of the rope is 4.

All ways it can be cut into parts: 1+3, 1+1+2, 1+1+1+1, 2+2, 2+1+1.

Among these, 2+2 cut makes for the greatest product: 2*2=4.



Notes

Input Parameters: Function has one argument, an integer length of the rope.



Output Format: Return an integer, maximum possible product of the given rope’s parts.



Constraints:

2 <= length of the rope <= 111
You have to cut at least once.
Length of the rope, lengths of all parts are all positive integers.


JavaScript solutions will give “Wrong Answer” for the test cases from 023 to 029 because the answers exceed Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER. If your JavaScript solution passes all the test cases except 023 to 029 and the latter tests your answers differ insignificantly, conconsider your solution correct.
